        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious flat iron steak was created from a combination of different recipes that I read. I combined, adjusted, and finally perfected the marinade and cooking time to my taste. I'm sure you will love it as well. After all, it is perfection!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
